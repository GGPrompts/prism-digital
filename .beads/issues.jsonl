The loader should display a rotating 3D prism/geometric shape with particle effects, progress indication, and smooth fade-out transition.\n\n### Key Files to Modify\n- **Primary**: `/src/components/ui/Loader.tsx` - Replace 2D animations with 3D canvas\n- **Support**: `/src/components/canvas/CanvasWrapper.tsx` - Already renders the Loader component\n- **Reference**: `/src/components/canvas/PrismCenterpiece.tsx` - Use as reference for 3D prism geometry and material patterns\n- **Reference**: `/src/components/canvas/Effects.tsx` - Bloom/vignette post-processing patterns\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n#### 1. Create a 3D Loader Scene Component\nCreate a new component (`Loader3DScene.tsx`) that uses R3F to render:\n- **Prism Geometry**: Use triangular prism (reference PrismCenterpiece.tsx lines 36-56)\n- **Rotation**: Smooth multi-axis rotation that scales with progress\n- **Materials**: MeshTransmissionMaterial with adaptive settings based on device (see PrismCenterpiece.tsx lines 109-141)\n- **Lighting**: Point lights for purple glow effect (reference lines 147-150)\n- **Post-Processing**: Bloom effect for glowing appearance (see Effects.tsx Bloom component)\n\n#### 2. Update Loader.tsx Structure\n- Keep existing wrapper and progress bar/text logic\n- Replace the SVG prism shape (lines 32-46) with a Canvas element using the 3D scene\n- Use Canvas component from @react-three/fiber with minimal viewport (e.g., 200x200px)\n- Keep the fade-out transition and cleanup logic (lines 10-22)\n- Maintain progress tracking and active state detection from useProgress hook\n\n#### 3. Performance Considerations\n- Use Suspense with null fallback (already pattern in CanvasWrapper)\n- Leverage existing device detection patterns for adaptive quality\n- Disable expensive effects on mobile (bloom radius, transmission samples)\n- Use Preload helper for async asset loading\n- Respect the PerformanceMonitor DPR scaling approach\n\n#### 4. Animation Details\n- **Rotation**: Speed increases subtly with load progress (0.1 -\u003e 0.3 rad/s)\n- **Scale**: Slight pulse effect (1.0 -\u003e 1.2 scale) on repeat\n- **Particles**: Optional: subtle floating particles around prism (if no performance impact)\n- **Color**: Purple/violet theme matching brand (use #a855f7 base, #e9d5ff highlight)\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] 3D prism loader renders in place of 2D animation\n- [ ] Rotation animation is smooth and engaging (60fps target)\n- [ ] Progress bar accurately reflects load state (0-100%)\n- [ ] Smooth fade-out transition when loading completes (700ms duration)\n- [ ] Works on mobile (no WebGL2 features, adaptive material)\n- [ ] No console errors or WebGL warnings\n- [ ] Passes visual QA (gate:visual-qa)\n- [ ] Code review approved (gate:codex-review)\n\n### Testing Checklist\n- Test on high-end device (full effects)\n- Test on low-end mobile (fallback materials)\n- Verify no memory leaks in useFrame loop\n- Check performance under load (FPS target: 60+)\n- Verify fade-out completes before next page interaction\n\n### Notes\n- Do NOT create a separate canvas context - embed Canvas directly in Loader.tsx or a sub-component\n- Reuse device detection patterns from CanvasWrapper\n- Keep file size lean - focus on prism + glow, skip complex particles if they impact performance\n- The existing Loader.tsx already has the right structure; just swap the prism rendering","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:36:41.405240427-05:00","created_by":"marci","updated_at":"2026-01-22T03:00:27.246363856-05:00","labels":["3d","animation","loader","ux"]}

Add Raycasting Infrastructure (Both Components)\n- Import useThree hook to access raycaster: `import { useThree } from \"@react-three/fiber\"`\n- Store hover state in refs to avoid re-renders\n- Use useFrame to perform raycasting each frame\n- Pattern:\n  ```typescript\n  const raycaster = useRef(new THREE.Raycaster());\n  const hoverState = useRef(false);\n  \n  useFrame((state) =\u003e {\n    raycaster.current.setFromCamera(state.mouse, state.camera);\n    const intersects = raycaster.current.intersectObject(meshRef.current);\n    hoverState.current = intersects.length \u003e 0;\n  });\n  ```\n\n#### 2. Hover Visual Effects (FloatingShapes)\n- Scale: Lerp to 1.15x when hovering, back to 1.0x when not\n- Emissive intensity: Increase from 0.8 to 1.2 on hover\n- Material opacity: Keep opacity smooth during transitions\n- Cursor: Change to pointer when hovering\n\n#### 3. Hover Visual Effects (PrismCenterpiece)\n- Scale: Subtle increase to 1.1x on hover\n- Rotation speed: Slightly increase rotation intensity during hover\n- Emission: Increase material brightness/emissiveIntensity\n- Add subtle glow increase\n\n#### 4. Cursor Management (Use drei useCursor)\n- Import: `import { useCursor } from \"@react-three/drei\"`\n- Call `useCursor(hoverState.current)` in both components\n- Handles cursor changes automatically\n\n#### 5. Performance Considerations\n- Raycasting is done once per frame in useFrame - efficient\n- Use refs for hover state to avoid re-renders\n- Smooth lerp transitions (0.1-0.15 factor) for visual polish\n- Test on mobile: ensure raycasting doesn't cause jank\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- FloatingShapes respond to mouse hover with scale and emissive changes\n- PrismCenterpiece responds to mouse hover with subtle scale/brightness increase\n- Cursor changes to pointer when hovering over interactive elements\n- Transitions are smooth using lerp interpolation\n- Works with both mouse and touch interactions\n- No performance regression on mobile devices\n- Visual feedback is subtle but clearly noticeable\n\n### Testing Checklist\n- Desktop: Hover over floating shapes, see scale and glow change\n- Desktop: Hover over central prism, see response\n- Mobile/tablet: Touch elements, confirm feedback works\n- Performance: Check DevTools performance tab for jank\n- Gates: Run visual-qa and codex-review after implementation\n\n### Reference Implementation\nBoth components already use useFrame and have mesh refs. Add raycasting logic alongside existing animation logic. Keep state in refs, apply lerping to material properties (scale, emissive, opacity).\n\n### Notes\n- Use THREE.Raycaster from three.js (already imported in both files)\n- Keep hover effects subtle - avoid excessive scale changes (max 1.1-1.15x)\n- Consider mobile: raycasting works on touch but may feel different than mouse\n- Sync with existing animation patterns (useFrame, lerp, smooth transitions)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T12:35:20.660924171-05:00","created_by":"marci","updated_at":"2026-01-22T03:00:41.891951566-05:00","labels":["3d","hover","interaction","r3f"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"PD-6zm","depends_on_id":"PD-1sv","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-22T02:58:29.87143886-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
